# Chess23
### Chess23 - A Java Chess Game 🎮♟️

Welcome to **Chess23**, a chess game built entirely in Java using Object-Oriented Programming principles. This project demonstrates my understanding of OOP concepts and design while creating a fully functional chess game.

#### Features 🌟
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for an engaging visual experience.
- **Terminal-Based Interface (TBI)** for a simple and efficient gameplay experience.
- Dynamic game mechanics:
  - Movement validation for all chess pieces.
  - Detection of check and checkmate scenarios.
  - Capture and promotion rules.
- Save game progress for later analysis.
- Comprehensive error and exception handling for smooth gameplay.

#### How to Run 🚀
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Chess23.git
   cd Chess23
   ```
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
4. Choose your preferred game mode:
   - Enter `GUI` for a graphical user interface.
   - Enter `TBI` for a terminal-based interface.

#### Project Goals 🎯
This project highlights:
- The use of **generics** for improved type safety in the code.
- Implementation of **design patterns** like composition and aggregation.
- Applying **unit tests** for reliability and robustness.

#### Contributions 🤝
I welcome contributions! Feel free to fork the repository, report issues, or suggest enhancements.

#### Future Enhancements 🚀
- Multiplayer mode for online games.
- Enhanced GUI with animations and sound effects.

Check out the code, enjoy the game, and feel free to share your feedback! 😊
